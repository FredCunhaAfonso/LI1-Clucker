Immerse yourself in a third-person, procedurally generated world, assuming the role of a wandering protagonist in pursuit of achieving the utmost score in the captivating game of "DOOM FROGGER CLUCKER".
This project was assigned with the intention of furthering my familiarity with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and its library [Gloss](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/).
