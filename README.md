#

Immerse yourself in a third-person, procedurally generated world, assuming the role of a wandering protagonist in pursuit of achieving the utmost score in the captivating game of "DOOM FROGGER CLUCKER".
This project was assigned with the intention of furthering my familiarity with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and its library [Gloss](http://gloss.ouroborus.net/).


Although there is no way to [understand how the final project works](doc/html/doc-index.html), I advise you to


## try it out for yourself

###    [1. Install GHC and cabal](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)

###    2. Install all necessary libraries (Gloss) 

        ```bash
        cabal update
        cabal install --lib gloss
        ```
    
###    3. Get this repository's content into some directory

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/pedrofp4444/Crossy-Road-Plus.git
        ```

###    4. Get into the [src](src/) directory

        ```bash
        cd LI1-Clucker/src
        ```

###    5. Compile

        ```bash
        ghc Main.hs
        ```

###    6. PLAY!

        ```bash
        ./Main
        ```
